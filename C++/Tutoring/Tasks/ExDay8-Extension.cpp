Pointers
Theory Questions
1.	Explain the concept of pointers in C++ and how they are used.
2.	What is a null pointer? How is it different from an uninitialized pointer?

Coding Questions
3.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of pointers. Create a pointer to an integer and manipulate its value.
4.	Write a C++ program that uses a pointer to an array to calculate the sum of its elements.
Object Oriented Programming

Theory Questions
5.  What are the four main principles of Object Oriented Programming?
6.	How does encapsulation improve code maintainability and security in C++?
Coding Questions
7.	Write a C++ program that demonstrates encapsulation by defining a class with private data members and public methods.
8.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate abstraction using an abstract class with pure virtual functions.

Classes
Theory Questions
9.	Define a class in C++ and explain the significance of access specifiers.
10.	What is a constructor in C++? How does it differ from a destructor?
Coding Questions
11.	Write a C++ class 'Person' with attributes for name and age. Include methods to set and get these attributes.
12.	Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of constructors by initializing objects of a class 'Book' with title and author.

Inheritance
Theory Questions
13.	Explain the concept of inheritance in C++ and its advantages.
14.	What is the difference between public, protected, and private inheritance?
Coding Questions
15.	Write a C++ program that demonstrates single inheritance. Create a base class 'Vehicle' and a derived class 'Car'.
16.	Write a C++ program that demonstrates multiple inheritance using two base classes 'Engine' and 'Body' and a derived class 'Car'.

Polymorphism
Theory Questions
17.	What is polymorphism in C++? Give an example.
18.	Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism.
Coding Questions
19.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate function overloading.
20.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate virtual functions and runtime polymorphism.

Operator Overloading
Theory Questions
21.	What is operator overloading in C++? Why is it useful?
22.	Which operators cannot be overloaded in C++?
Coding Questions
23.	Write a C++ program to overload the '+' operator to add two complex numbers.
24.	Write a C++ program to overload the '<<' operator for outputting the contents of a class 'Box'.

Conversion
Theory Questions
25.	Explain the concept of type conversion in C++.
26.	What is the difference between implicit and explicit conversion in C++?
Coding Questions
27.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate implicit type conversion.
28.	Write a C++ program to demonstrate explicit type conversion using casting.
